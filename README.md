# ESL-Installer
This is an installer for [Ozzfest's Easy Solo Lobby](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/red-dead-redemption-2-a/412902-100-easy-solo-lobby.html)  
Also [Easy Solo Lobby Installer](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/red-dead-redemption-2-a/491745-easy-solo-tool-installer.html) in Unknown Cheats

### Functions
- Checks if Red Dead Online is running
- Checks if the Installer is in the correct folder
- Auto detects if it needs installation or uninstallation
- Dialog window to select folder
- Checks if the chosen folder is the correct folder
- Option to launch the game automatically after installation

There is also a function that I created and named **Lobby Key**, this function does the same as what [this](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/2811009-post176.html) topic shows  
The **Lobby Key** function does the following
- Allows you to choose the Lobby Key during installation
- Checks if there is already a Lobby Key installed
- Checks if there is an ESL installation without the Lobby Key

### Translate
If you want to translate to your language, save [this](https://gist.github.com/faelBrunnoS/851308ce8fc947d8f8b67392983618cd) file, translate it and then create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the translation and send me the link.

I'm Brazilian and I speak Portuguese, I understand something in English!  
But the installer was translated by Google Translate  
If you think any term or phrase fits better with what was written, feel free to send me the translated file above.
